# 7. Force.md

## tldr:
- Fallback, Receive, and functions with the "payable decorator are used to receive ETH, but can be bypassed
- Why Force ETH anywhere?
  - Spring Cleaning - Clean old contracts or contracts that have completed their tasks. Comes in handly to move ETH, then destory the contract.
  - A bad way to upgrade contracts? Destroy the old and in with the new?
  - Break Glass - If there is an emergency and the creator needs to prevent any further damage from happening, they could call "selfdestruct"
- Hacks/Vulnerabilities
  - Forcing ETH into a contract, taking ownership if access control is based on who sends ETH (e.g. Owner to a contract (e.g. require == owner))
  - "this.balance" - Avoig being dependent on exact values of the balnce of the contract because it can be artificially manipulated.
  - Invariant Checking
    - Good Invariant (fixed) - Total Supply of a token
    - Bad Invariant (can change) - The current Ether stored in a contract (can change usin self destruct, pushing more Ether into the contract)
