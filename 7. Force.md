# 7. Force.md

## tldr:
- The selfdestruct(address) function removes all bytecode from the contract address and sends all ether stored to the specified address. If this specified address is also a contract, no functions (including the fallback) get called.
- Fallback, Receive, and functions with the "payable decorator are used to receive ETH, but can be bypassed
- Why Force ETH anywhere?
  - Spring Cleaning - Clean old contracts or contracts that have completed their tasks. Comes in handly to move ETH, then destory the contract.
  - A bad way to upgrade contracts? Destroy the old and in with the new?
  - Break Glass - If there is an emergency and the creator needs to prevent any further damage from happening, they could call "selfdestruct"
- Hacks/Vulnerabilities
  - Forcing ETH into a contract, taking ownership if access control is based on who sends ETH (e.g. Owner to a contract (e.g. require == owner))
  - "this.balance" - Avoig being dependent on exact values of the balnce of the contract because it can be artificially manipulated.
  - Invariant Checking
    - Good Invariant (fixed) - Total Supply of a token
    - Bad Invariant (can change) - The current Ether stored in a contract (can change using self destruct, pushing more Ether into the contract)
- Never trust your own accounting: Even as an owner of the contract, you do not control your contract’s balance. Never use contract balance as an accounting or auth check.
- Even if you didn’t implement a selfdestruct(), it is still possible through any delegatecall() vulnerabilities.
- If you implement a selfdestruct, i) authenticate that the msg.sender = owner and ii) emit an event for external dependencies on this contract and for future reference.
