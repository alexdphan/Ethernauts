# 6. Delegation.md

## tldr:
- Use the higher level call() function to inherit from libraries, especially when you:
  - i) don’t need to change contract storage
  - ii) do not care about gas control.
- When inheriting from a library intending to alter your contract’s storage, make sure to line up your storage slots with the library’s storage slots to avoid these edge cases
- Authenticate and do conditional checks on functions that invoke delegatecalls.
- Read solidity documentation on security considerations.
